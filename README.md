# Computational Physics Portfolio
## Courtney Linden

This project-based computational physics course taught me how to build, solve, validate, and communicate mathematical models of physical systems. Throughout the semester, we studied techniques for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, data analysis, error analysis, and parallel computing. Everything I learned in the course can be applied to various fields.

The entire program was written in Python and ran in a Jupyter notebook. We learned about ODEs, lists, arrays, curve fitting, and local and global variables. Through projects, we were also able to explore and investigate scientific problems. I researched different projects in physics, biochemistry, and chemistry projects.

I wanted to take this course to learn about computational modeling. Dr. Titus told me a lot about this course, which piqued my interest. I had taken a few coding classes in high school, so I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up, but Dr. Titus assured me that I would be fine.

I want to thank Dr. Aaron Titus for teaching me and guiding me throughout the entire process.

[Exploration of Neon](https://github.com/clinden7/CP-Portfolio-/blob/3df89dcb6cafbc2790706f0add30208287a9101b/Exploration-of-Neon.ipynb)
* Neon atoms were explored using the Ideal Gas Law model. Diving into this project by making predictions on what will happen when changing the system's temperature.

[Enzyme Kinetics](https://github.com/clinden7/CP-Portfolio-/blob/60779ccf880b4e386bbf270acae5c45670bc421f/Enzyme-Kinetics.ipynb)
* This project explored the relationship between Enzyme, Substrate, and product concentrations. ODEs (differential equations) were used based on the ideal reaction.
